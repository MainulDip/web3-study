* DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
* NFTs: (non-fungible tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated.
* faucets: A crypto faucet lets users earn small crypto rewards by completing simple tasks. There are various kinds of crypto faucets, including bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB faucets.
