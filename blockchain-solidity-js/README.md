### Terms:
* Smart Contract: Contracts/Promises on a decentralized network.......
* Oracle: a decentralized network
* Daap: Decentralized App
* Defi : Decentralized Finance
* on-chain/off-chain:
* Immutability of smart contract: Once deployed, it is immutable, cannot be alterd or changed
* DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
* NFTs: (non-fungible tokens) are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated.
* faucets: A crypto faucet lets users earn small crypto rewards by completing simple tasks. There are various kinds of crypto faucets, including bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB faucets.
* Gas: A unit of computational measurement. The more complex the transaction the more gas is used. "Gas unit price" * "Gas Used" = "Transaction Fee"
* Genesis Block : The first block in a blockchain. No previous block before this exists
* hash : unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data
* hash algorithm: function that computes data into a quique hash
* mining: The process of finding the "solution" to the blockchain "problem". Like find the matching "nonce" for a hash in a block. Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
* block : A combination of nonce, previous unique hash, current unique hash and transactions that mined together. But implementation is different among different blockchain algorithm.
* nonce : A "number used once" to find the solution to the blockchain problem (may be by bruteforcing, so heavey computation is used). It's also used to define the transaction numbr for an account/address.
* Keccak-256: Ethereum's Cryptographic Hash Function
* Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm: Used to generate public key based on private key on ETH
* signature verificaiton: signature is hashed based on private key and can be verrified by public key
* Gas | Block Rewards & EIP 1559:
 - Base Gas Fee: that will cost/consumed by network fee
 - Max Gas Fee : we are willing to pay
 - Mas Priority : Max Gas Price + Tip for miners
 - Brunt : total transaction fee - miner fee = Brunt (Network fee)

* Input data: 0x
* Node : A single instance in a decentralized network
## Step by Step Wallet Init and Transaction:
* First thing is setting up the wallet (I.E: at Metamask). To separate workflow use brave. and install metamask's browser extension.

* Backup Faucet: https://goerlifaucet.com/

### Study Placements
Study 1 or 2 hours per day, maybe first of the day. Do it incrementally, take around 2 months, don't try to do it fast. Just 1 or 2 hours per day, also skip some days.......
